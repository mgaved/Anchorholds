 <p>The Creekside Discovery Centre is run by the Creekside Education Trust, a
company with charitable status. Creekside Education Trust (CET) was founded in
1999. The Trust's mission is to work with the local and wider community to
sustain and promote the regeneration of Deptford Creek through education,
conservation and the forging of partnerships. The CET also aims to act as a
voice for nature conservation and biodiversity in the area. CET is committed to
the long-term management of Deptford Creek for people and wildlife. Connecting
real people with really wild wildlife.</br>
The Centre works with others to promote the long term care of the Creek by: - Providing opportunities for access, real
information and opportunities to get involved. - Keeping a watchful eye on the
flora and fauna and trying to deal with problem issues as they arise. - Provide
a focal point and voice for the Creek. Facilitating sessions on local habitats,
their management and the value of the local wildlife living there. - Offering
ecological planning advice for Creek wall improvements and local habitats to
developers and partners. If you are interested in finding out more about CET or
would like to get involved in our work, please contact the <a href="http://www.creeksidecentre.org.uk">Creekside Discovery
