      <p>There was famously a wooden bridge at this crossing point which charged a toll until it was closed in 1920’s after falling into disrepair.
<P></P>
It’s modern replacement is a steel lifting mechanism opened in 2002, which continues to allow access for boats that occasionally make their way up and down the creek. A long local campaign and collaboration from all sectors of the local community succeeded in getting it designed and built.
<P></P>
One of it’s key protagonists Pete Pope died in 2012 and his ashes were scattered into the creek from here in noisy celebration..
<P>
When the bridge was lifted recently to release the Aileen Claire fishing boat there was a bit of a surprise for those who had made a home under the structure as their secret homes were exposed. 
<P>
