      <img src="../images/9_image_3.jpg" class="bg-img">

      <p>The pub here was formerly known as <a href="http://www.olddeptfordhistory.com/2010/01/birds-nest-formerly-oxford-arms.html">Oxford Arms</a>. It hosted such big names as Squeeze and Dire Straits and continues today to bring top bands to Deptford. <P>
      Further back in the 16th century, the pub was a centre for arts. Deptford Theatre was joined to the pub where the playwright, Christopher Marlowe was known to visit. <P>The Theatre lends this name to the Theatre Arm of the Creek where many boats are now moored. It was also known as Sun Coal Wharf and stood very close to a Tidemill. <P>
      These names are all still in use today for nearby locations. Deptford <a href="http://transpont.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/deptford-church-street-1881.html">bloggers</a> have written about these histories in more detail. </p>
