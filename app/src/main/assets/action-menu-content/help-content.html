  <h1>Anchorholds help</h1>
  <h2>Anchorholds and Bluetooth - setting up your phone</h2>
  <p>The Anchorholds app will tell you when you are near an 'Anchorhold'. This is small box placed indoors or outdoors that sends a signal to the Anchorholds app on your phone. If you pass an anchorhold when you are viewing the 'Anchorholds you have visited' summary screen on your phone, you will see a notification appear, like an SMS text message. There may be a slight delay before the phone reacts. If you are not viewing the 'Anchorholds you have visited' screen when you pass an anchorhold, your phone will alert you by vibrating and it will add a notification to the summary list. So even if you are not looking at the app, it will collect information about beacons nearby for you to read later, if the app is running in the background. </p>
  <p>For the app to work it must use Bluetooth on your phone. If you turn off Bluetooth, the app will not detect any Anchorholds. So please check that Bluetooth is ON. Also, if you switch the phone to Flight Mode, the app will not detect any beacons. So please check that Flight Mode (or Airplane Mode) is OFF. Also, when you switch on your phone, you must start the Anchorholds app before you look for anchorholds.</p>
  <h2>Anchorholds you have visited - summary screen</h2>
  <p>When you tap on the Anchorholds app icon, this opens the summary screen. The summary screen shows you a list of all the anchorholds you have visited. You see a notification for each place you have visited, for example, the Creekside Discovery Centre.</p>
    <p>You can tell the difference between unread (new) and read (old) places in the list by the different colour of the text. Unread (new) notifications have black text, but notifications you have read earlier have grey text. If you visit the same anchorhold again within 6 hours, you will NOT get a new notification. But if the delay is more than 6 hours, the app sees the same anchorhold as new.</p>
    <h2>To open the content from the notification </h2>
      <p>When you tap a notification in the summary list, it will open the content for that location, for example 'The Hoy Kitchen'. You will see the Home page. </p>
      <h2>To delete the notification</h2>
  <p>IMPORTANT: If you touch a notification in the summary list for a longer time, it will open the 'delete' bar at the top of the screen (with an icon of a waste bin). </p>
  <p>Be careful not to delete the notification accidentally! If you delete the notification, you will have to wait for 6 hours and visit the anchorhold again to see that content. If you want to keep the notification, just tap the notification again (NOT the waste bin) and you will see the summary list. </p>
  <p>If you are sure you want to delete the notification, touch the waste bin icon at the top right. You cannot undo this action. </p>
 

   <h2>To move between screens in the app</h2>
  <p>On the scenario Home page, you can scroll down to see the introduction and other text on the Home page. Each scenario has five sections, which you can reach from the Home page: Environment, History, Social, Grammar, and Map.</p>
  <p>The words in blue are links to other screens in the app. So, if you want to go to the History from the Home page, touch the word 'History' in blue. Some words in the transcript are blue. If you touch a blue word, it will take you to another screen with more about that word or phrase. </p>
  <p>To get back to the previous page, use the 'back' button on the phone (an arrow turning a corner). To go to the app Home page or one of the sections, touch the three small white squares in the top right of the screen (on the blue bar). This opens a menu in a blue box. Touch the section you want to go to. </p>
  <p>If you get very lost in the app, touch the HOME button on the phone (looks like a house) to see the main screen for the phone. Then open the Anchorholds app again and start from the summary screen.</p>
