      <p><b>Erica:</b> Hi, I’d like to get to London on Friday please. What’s the cheapest way?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> Coming back the same day?</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> I’m not sure. Does it make a difference?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> Day return is £15.50. <a href="vocab.html#open_return">Open return</a> is £22.00.</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> Ok. Is it right that with an open return I can come back whenever I want?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> Yes that’s right, as long as it’s within 1 month.</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> And I can come back on any train? I don’t have to book a specific train?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> If you book an <a href="vocab.html#advance">advance</a> ticket now you have to book your train. You have to come back at the time <a href="vocab.html#indicated">indicated</a> on your ticket and sit in your <a href="vocab.html#allocated_seat">allocated seat</a>. But you do save a lot of money by booking ahead.</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> Ok. So I’ll book a day return now. Leaving at 10:15 and returning at 19:43. I will have my daughter with me as well. She’s two years old. Will we get any <a href="vocab.html#concession">concessions</a>?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> I’m afraid you won’t. But she will. Children under 5 travel free. Have you got a railcard at all?</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> No I haven’t. How do I get one of those?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> I can recommend a Network Rail card. You get 30% off your fare on <a href="vocab.html#regional_train">regional trains</a> if you travel after 10:00am. You pay just £30 for the card so you can make <a href="vocab.html#regional_train">significant</a> savings if you’re a regular traveller.</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> Great, I have more travel plans this month, so it would be smart to get a railcard now, wouldn’t it? </p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> It certainly would. All you need to do is fill out this form. Let me take you through your <a href="vocab.html#itinerary">itinerary</a> in the meantime. So <a href="vocab.html#outbound">outbound</a> journey – depart 10:15, arrive 10:50 at London Euston. Return 19:43… unfortunately due to planned engineering works you’ll need to <a href="vocab.html#alight">alight</a> at Bletchley. There’s a <a href="vocab.html#replacement_bus_service">replacement bus service</a> between Bletchley and Milton Keynes Central.</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> Oh I see. I think that’ll be fine though. I live near Bletchley so we’ll get off there. Thanks. Here is the form. And £30 for the card. Do I get the discount straight away?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer:</b> You certainly do. It’s £40.85 altogether please. If you’d just like to pop your card in the machine….</p>
